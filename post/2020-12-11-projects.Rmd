first, lets load the reticulate and tidyverse packages
```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
```


lets import numpy create arbitrary data and run some stats.
```{python}

import numpy as np
array=np.random.rand(5)
ar2 = array+5
print(array)
print(array.mean())
print(array[3])
print(ar2-array)
print(np.corrcoef(array, ar2))
```
pass this array into r and run some summary statistics
```{r}
mean(py$array)
length(py$array)
summary(py$array)
```
regular expressions can help you parse strings for characters you are looking for and perform actions on them
```{python}
import re
string1 = "we want willy wonkas winning winks"
print(re.findall(r"w", string1))
print(re.sub(r"w","l",string1))
print(re.match(r"w",string1) )
```
There are still more functions to be explored, but these are the basics.
