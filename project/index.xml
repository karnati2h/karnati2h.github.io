      <description># The 1st dataset I chose documents the amount of people who # were tested on each day in Chicago from 3/01/2020 to # 10/07/2020 and which day of the week it was. The second # dataset documents the number of cases, deaths, and # hospitalizations on each day across the same date range. # Both datasets were acquired by surveying medical providers # for which of their clients were tested, hospitalized, # diagnosed positive, and the resulting deaths.</description>
